# pepper-python-gui
This is a really simple GUI for controlling Pepper using Python and Tkinter.
# Usage
Download the files into one folder so that the main python file is able to import all the other python files. Run the file using `python main.py` and enter the details of Pepper, which includes the IP address and port.
# Issues
There may be issues connecting to the robot. To ensure that it is not a problem with the program itself. go to a web browser on the same machine the program is running on (or some other machine on the same network) and go to the robots webpage (`IP:PORT1`). If this works, then there is a problem with the program connecting to the robot. Check the command line for more information.
